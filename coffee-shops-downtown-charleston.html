            <h2>Planning Your Downtown Coffee Walk</h2>
            <p>Downtown Charleston's compact layout makes it perfect for a coffee crawl. Most of these shops are within comfortable walking distance of each other, allowing you to explore multiple locations in a single outing. Start your day on King Street, work your way toward the waterfront, and discover the unique character each coffee shop brings to Charleston's downtown landscape.</p>
            
            <p>The best time to visit downtown coffee shops is typically weekday mornings when locals are getting their daily fix, or weekend afternoons when the pace is more relaxed. Many shops offer outdoor seating when weather permits, perfect for Charleston's mild spring and fall seasons. Don't hesitate to ask baristas for recommendations – Charleston's coffee community is friendly and passionate about sharing their knowledge.</p>
            
            <p>Remember that parking downtown can be challenging, especially during peak tourist seasons. Consider walking from your hotel, using the free downtown trolley, or parking in one of the public garages and exploring on foot. The walkable distances between coffee shops make downtown Charleston ideal for a leisurely coffee-focused walking tour of the Holy City.</p>
